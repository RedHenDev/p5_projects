How to Code the Snake Game: tutorial 1

First, I show you how to get started using javascript and the p5.js library. You will learn the simple steps of downloading p5 and linking files to your html file. 

Next, we code the basic graphics and keyboard input, with the traditional snake controls (i.e. you cannot move left, immediately, if you are currently moving right -- so that the snake doesn't try to 'move back through' its own body).

In the next video, we will code the all-important snake segments that trail behind the head of the snake.

Thanks for watching!
