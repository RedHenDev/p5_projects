In this (second) video I show you how to create lots of objects quickly (with arrays), and how to detect collisions between those objects (collision detection). This is coded in javaScript, using the p5 library (see links below for help with p5!).

In this (third) video I show you how to use collisions between objects to have an effect on those objects, such as bouncing off one another, and drawing 'connecting lines' between objects that have collided before. Will this look cool -- or disgusting?!
